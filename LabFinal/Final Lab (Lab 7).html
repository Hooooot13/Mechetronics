<p>Final Lab (represents approximately 4 weekly labs)</p>
<p>Assignment: Design a complete mechatronic system, assemble, test and demonstrate to lab TA or instructor. Also test this system on other users (not members of the class).</p>
<p>The mechatronic system can be one of your choosing. It can be a complete product, or a working, bench-top prototype of a product. The system must have 2 our more sensors, 2 or more actuators, logic control through a microcontroller (use the processor from class), and human-machine interface (HMI). You should use one or more design elements from the course implemented into your project. Examples are motion profiling, motor modeling, sensor modeling, data filtering, etc. You should also incorporate &nbsp;a minimum of four of the following functionalities: ADC, timer counter, external interrupt, PWM, real-time interrupt, LCD display.</p>
<p>Reporting will follow the long lab report form. The lab assessment will follow the basic rubric with larger emphasis on design issues, modeling, system representation and reporting on and evaluating the operational performance of the system.</p>
