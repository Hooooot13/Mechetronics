<p>This lab will introduce the use of interrupt service routines in the ATMega2560. For the ATmega, this is done through the timer overflow interrupts on the 5 timers (T0, 1, 3,4 and 5). The internal service routine is a fucntion that is called - not by software - but by hardware. In this example, it is called based on a timing action (overflow of one of the timers). This is an extremely useful capability of microcontrollers. you now have a function that occurs at fixed, accurate, Real-time rates. Uses for this are primarily control (all controllers will make use of this), repeated, timed events, or creating timers, etc.</p>

<p>For this lab, we will use an ISR to create a timer. For this lab, do the following: Create a program with an ISR that creates a clock that you can use. The clock should have some basic timing functions (show elapsed time, countdown time, set an alarm or do something else when the time goes off). You can integrate this timing function into an earlier lab such as the recipe, or build a new device that uses your timer.</p>
